## Initial Remarks

- The exercises should be solved inside a function per exercise with the format `exercise_{n}(...)` (multiple functions can be used but the main function should have that format)
- The code will be tested automatically, which means the functions should be ready to receive and return the exact same inputs\outputs as the ones specified in the test cases
- The variable `full_name` should be filled with your full name
- Attach a `.zip` file containing the code to the MS Teams assignment until the deadline
